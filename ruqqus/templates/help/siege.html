# Guild Siege

In order to ensure that Ruqqus Guilds can be curated and managed, users may use this page to try to "lay siege" to, and take over, a guild with inactive Guildmasters.

You may attempt to siege a guild once every 7 days. Any siege attempt - whether successful or not - will trigger this cool-down period.

## Requirements

In order to successfully siege a guild you must meet the following requirements:

* Have a 30 day old account, and
* Wait 7 days since your last siege attempt, and
* Not be exiled from the guild you are attempting to siege, and
* Have Rep in the guild you are attempting to siege (exact requirement depends on guild size and age)

Additionally, no current Guildmaster (or no Guildmaster above you, if you are a Guildmaster already) may have done any of the following in the past 60 days:

* Create a post in the guild being sieged
* Create a comment in the guild being sieged
* Perform a mod action in the guild being sieged

Guildmasters who are permanently banned, or who have deactivated their Ruqqus account, will always count as inactive, regardless of actual activity.

Sieges against [+general](/+general), or admin-controlled Guilds such as [+Ruqqus](/+Ruqqus) or [+RuqqusPress](/+RuqqusPress), will always fail.

## Siege a Guild
